i need to rethink TableState and filters

TableState should mimic the ui

TableState should hold a list of filter rules so i can build the drop down from these rules

clicking apply should then apply them, can probably just build the query and apply it in one step, maybe save 
the query in state so that when sorting i dont have to rebuild the query, it may not matter though
